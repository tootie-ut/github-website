# Initial thoughts on website contour556.com.au


The original website was cluttered with information and hard to navigate. The navigation bar was overloaded with menu items, some items were duplicated and others with expired links. The website was fairly picture/ video heavy with minimal text. It clearly needed some love and attention. 

As I am a neophyte coder, I went the logical approach and kept the website as simple as possible. I wrote a list of everything on the website and ruthlessly de-cluttered the list. 

### The original website

•	Videos
•	Festivals (by year)
•	About us page
•	Contact us page
•	Donate page
•	Media – links to external websites and articles
•	Radio links- these were mostly expired
•	Media releases
•	Supporters
•	Social media links

### My website

•	Artists (Combine all previous years) + add 2022 artist (when available)
•	Our team
•	Donate
•	Map/ Location
•	Search bar

The two major things I believed the website needed were a search bar and a map.

**Search bar**

A tool to help guide you through the website, search for artists, events, locations etc.

**Map**

The map was an important feature to add to the website. As the festival is spread across numerous locations in Canberra. A map with pinpoints (markers) would truly benefit the website. This page would assist people in visualising how they would approach the festival. The page could even suggest recommended routes and performance dates. 

## My approach on building the website/where I got stuck

My approach did not necessarily go to plan. I originally thought the most logical approach to the project was to keep everything separate. Index.html paired with its own stlye.css, an artist.html with its own stlyeartist.css and so on. Boy, this was not a good idea. My coding was everywhere, and it was overwhelming to grasp what I was doing.

In week six, we were introduced to css grid. I desperately wanted to understand and implement this code, but it further complicated things. I mainly kept with flexbox.

What I ended up doing was printing out all my style sheets and html codes.
Highlighting borders, creating classes, and grouping the items. This dramatically helped my progress. 

## My inspiration

### cowboy.com 
eBike shop
This website stood out to me because I liked the grey theme.

### echofestival.com.au
An art festival in Tasmania
I liked the subtle incorporation of orange and the dark themed website.

### dnaa.com.au 
An architect firm in Canberra
Simple lay out
Dark theme
White text on an image



# If I had more time/do the project again.

I committed to the dark theme website, however, now reflecting on it, the artworks are lost and not a feature to the website. The greyscale theme worked well for cowboy.com as they were using it as a backdrop to sell their bikes. If I were to do the project again, I would have the artwork displayed in large images as a gallery.
 

- Adding markers to the map page of all the artists
- Alphabetised list of artists - hover drop down menu on artist
- Video clips of performances
