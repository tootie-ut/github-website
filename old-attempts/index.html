            In 1952 Henri Cartier-Bresson, a founder of modern photojournalism, proposed one of the most fascinating and highly debated concepts in the history of photography: “the decisive moment.” This moment occurs when the visual and psychological elements of people in a real life scene spontaneously and briefly come together in perfect resonance to express the essence of that situation. Some people believe that the unique purpose of photography, as compared to other visual arts, is to capture this fleeting, quintessential, and holistic instant in the flow of life. For this reason, many photographers often mention the decisive moment, or similar ideas about capturing the essence of a transitory moment, when they describe their work.

            Now that I’ve proposed this deceptively simple definition of the DM, I’d like to explore the concept in more depth. Although Cartier-Bresson introduced this idea and is often viewed as the master of the DM, other photographers after him have expanded, revised, and challenged his concept, resulting in considerable complexity about what exactly the DM is. As a scholar specializing in the psychological study of photography and images, I find all of their ideas fascinating. Despite the fact that Cartier-Bresson’s thoughts have become the cri de corps among many photographers, especially photojournalists, they express their ideas mostly in philosophical and artistic terms. I see embedded in their discussions important ideas in psychology that have not been fully explored and articulated – some of those ideas being elements of classic psychology, while others coming from cutting-edge psychological theories.
